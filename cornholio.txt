 BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD WALKING TO STEWART'S HOUSE
Beavis: Hey! Butthead. How come we're going to Stewart's house?

Butthead: 'Cuz I heard he's got diarrhea.

Beavis: Oh. Yeah. heh heh

Stuart's mom: Thank you boys for bringing Stewart's homework to school for him. He's sooo sick. He spent all night in the bathroom.

Butthead: Really? Diarrhoea?

Stuart's mom: Yes, I'm afraid so.

Beavis & Butthead: heh heh ..... heh heh (Beavis imitates taking a dump)

Stuart's mom: Now boys.... come on. Say, have you boys eaten breakfast?

Butthead: Uhhhhhhh....

Beavis: Ummmmmmmmmm, I think I did once.

Stuart's mom: Well, you can't go to school on an empty stomach. Heeeeere. I made some breakfast burritos for Stewart. He's not feeling well enough to eat.

Butthead: Whoa! Burritos for breakfast!

Beavis: Yeah! Yeah! Cool!

Stuart's mom: You boys eat up. I'm going to check on Stewart. He probably needs more "T.P."

Butthead: Hey, Beavis. Ya think she's gonna put a thermometer up his butt?

Beavis: Yeah! And then she's gonna put it in his mouth!!

Beavis & Butthead: heh heh .... heh heh (eating burritos)

Beavis & Butthead: YEAAAAAAAAAACH! OOOOOOOOOAAH!! GAAAAAG!!

Butthead: What the hell is this crap? Ptui! This isn't a burrito!

Beavis: Yeah. I got eggs in mine! She tricked us!

Butthead: No wonder Stewart's got diarrhea.

Beavis: Yeah. heh heh..... Let's see what else they have.

TAKING ALL THE FOOD FROM THE KITCHEN
Butthead: This sucks! There's nothing good here. (Beavis finds where the sugar is kept) Hey! Buttmunch.... give me some...

Beavis: No way, punk! (Hyper attack)

Butthead: Settle down, Beavis..... pretty cool.

VAN DRIESSEN'S CLASSROOM
(Beavis having a Hyper Fit...)

Mr. Van Dreesen: It's ironic that we in this country who cherish freedom occasionally support governments who are less responsive to human rights. We're very fortunate.....(FADE OUT)....

Butthead: What's your problem Beavis? Settle down.

Mr. Van Dreesen: ...the struggle for freedom is by no means over. It still goes on today in places like.... Nicaragua... El Salvador... and Panama.

Beavis: (shirt over head) NIC..AR..A..GUA. Agua....Agua for my bunghole.... buunnghooooole!

Mr. Van Dreesen: Beavis! Please sit down...

Butthead: Uhhhh... he ate like 27 candy bars and then like drank a 6-pack of root beer!
